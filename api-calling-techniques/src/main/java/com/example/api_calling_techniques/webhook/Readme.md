## 🚀 Step 1: What is a Webhook?

**Webhook = Server-to-Server Push (event-based)**

> 🔁 Instead of the **client repeatedly calling (polling)** the server for updates, the **server pushes data to the client** when a specific event happens.

### 💡 In Simple Words:

- we **register a callback URL** (the webhook URL).
- When a specific event occurs (e.g., new data created, file uploaded, etc.), the **source server sends an HTTP POST** to that URL with event data.
- No need to pull. No need to wait. The update **comes automatically**.

## 🎯 When to Use Webhooks?

| Situation                        | Use Webhook? |
|----------------------------------|--------------|
| Need instant notifications       | ✅ Yes       |
| No need for client to control timing | ✅ Yes       |
| Periodic polling is wasteful     | ✅ Yes       |
| Need real-time communication from external systems | ✅ Yes       |

---

## 🧠 Pros & Cons of Webhooks

### ✅ Pros:
- **Real-time**: Instantly receive updates
- **Efficient**: No need for constant polling
- **Simple to implement**

### ❌ Cons:
- **One-way**: we only get data when the source server chooses to send it
- **Requires public accessible endpoint** (for the source system to send events)
- **Security must be handled manually** (e.g., secret keys, signature validation)

---

## 🛠 Step 2: Simulate Webhook System (with Python & Spring Boot)

We'll simulate a **webhook system** where:

- 🟢 **Python (Flask)** will act as the **source system**, and it will POST data to a webhook whenever something changes.
- 🟡 **Spring Boot** will act as the **receiver** (webhook listener).

---

### ✅ 2.1: Python Flask - Send Webhook Events

Create a basic webhook sender that simulates sending data every 10 seconds.

```python
# webhook_sender.py
from flask import Flask
import requests
import time
import random

app = Flask(__name__)

WEBHOOK_URL = "http://localhost:8080/webhook"

@app.route('/trigger', methods=['GET'])
def trigger_webhook():
    data = {
        "timestamp": time.time(),
        "value": random.randint(1, 100)
    }
    try:
        res = requests.post(WEBHOOK_URL, json=data)
        return f"Webhook sent, status: {res.status_code}"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error sending webhook: {str(e)}"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=5000)
```

> This gives we a **GET endpoint `/trigger`** which sends a **POST** to the webhook receiver.

---

### ✅ 2.2: Spring Boot - Receive Webhook

In our  existing Spring Boot project, add this:

```java
@RestController
public class WebhookReceiver {

    @PostMapping("/webhook")
    public ResponseEntity<String> receiveWebhook(@RequestBody Map<String, Object> payload) {
        System.out.println("Webhook received on thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        System.out.println("Payload: " + payload);
        return ResponseEntity.ok("Received");
    }
}
```

---

## 🔄 Flow:

1. Start Spring Boot server (`localhost:8080`)
2. Start Python server (`localhost:5000`)
3. Hit `GET http://localhost:5000/trigger`
4. We’ll see Spring Boot print the webhook event with timestamp and value.

---

## 🧪 Bonus: Automate Sending Webhook Periodically in Python

Want to simulate auto-events instead of hitting `/trigger`?

Modify Flask to send every X seconds:

```python
import threading

def start_sending():
    while True:
        time.sleep(10)
        data = {
            "timestamp": time.time(),
            "value": random.randint(1, 100)
        }
        try:
            res = requests.post(WEBHOOK_URL, json=data)
            print(f"Webhook sent. Status: {res.status_code}")
        except Exception as e:
            print("Error:", e)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    threading.Thread(target=start_sending).start()
    app.run(port=5000)
```

Now it’ll **automatically send events** every 10 seconds.

## ⚙️ How is Webhook Different From SSE / Polling?

| Feature          | Polling        | Long Polling     | SSE               | Webhook            |
|------------------|----------------|------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Who initiates?   | Client         | Client           | Client            | Server             |
| How often?       | Periodic       | On data change   | Continuous stream | On event only      |
| Direction        | Client → Server| Client → Server  | Server → Client   | Server → Server    |
| Real-time?       | ❌ No          | ⚠️ Kind of       | ✅ Yes            | ✅ Yes             |
| Server load      | ❌ High        | ⚠️ Moderate      | ✅ Low            | ✅ Very Low        |
| Internet needed? | Client pulls   | Client waits     | Persistent conn   | Needs public URL   |

---

## 🔐 Security for Webhooks (Optional But Recommended)

- Add **HMAC signature** in headers and verify it in the listener
- Use **secret tokens** or **API keys**
- Always respond with **200 OK** from the receiver to avoid retry loops

---

## 📌 Summary

- Webhook = server pushes data to our  endpoint when something happens.
- Use when we don’t want to constantly check or wait — let the event find us.
- Efficient, lightweight, and best for **event-based integrations**.
