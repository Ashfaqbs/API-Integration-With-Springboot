## WebFlux Overview

#### What is WebFlux and Why is it Used?
Spring WebFlux is a reactive web framework introduced in Spring 5 and enhanced in Spring Boot 3, designed for building non-blocking, asynchronous applications. Unlike traditional Spring Web (Spring MVC), which operates on a blocking, synchronous model, WebFlux leverages the Reactive Streams API to handle requests efficiently with minimal threads. It’s built to excel in scenarios requiring high scalability and concurrency, such as real-time data processing, streaming services, or applications with thousands of simultaneous users.

WebFlux is used because it addresses limitations of traditional blocking frameworks in modern, demanding environments. In a blocking model, each request ties up a thread until the operation completes, which can exhaust thread pools under heavy load, leading to performance bottlenecks. WebFlux, by contrast, uses a non-blocking, event-driven approach, allowing a small, fixed thread pool to manage multiple requests concurrently. This makes it ideal for I/O-bound applications—like those involving database queries or external API calls—where scalability and resource efficiency are critical.

### Key Differences Between WebFlux and Traditional REST APIs (Spring Web)

#### I/O Model:
- **WebFlux** is non-blocking, using asynchronous I/O to process requests without tying up threads.
- **Spring Web** is blocking, following a thread-per-request model where each request consumes a thread until completion.

#### Programming Model:
- **WebFlux** uses reactive types like `Mono` (for a single value) and `Flux` (for multiple values) from the Reactor library, enabling asynchronous data streams.
- **Spring Web** uses standard Java types (e.g., `String`, `List`), processing requests synchronously.

#### Server Support:
- **WebFlux** runs efficiently on non-servlet servers like **Netty**, optimized for high concurrency, though it can also use servlet containers.
- **Spring Web** relies on servlet containers like **Tomcat**, designed for blocking operations.

#### Scalability:
- **WebFlux** excels in high-concurrency scenarios, handling thousands of requests with fewer resources.
- **Spring Web** struggles under heavy load as thread pools can become exhausted.

### Two Primary Approaches to WebFlux

WebFlux offers two development styles, catering to different preferences:

#### **Annotation-Based Approach**
- Similar to Spring MVC, it uses familiar annotations like `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc., but returns reactive types (`Mono`, `Flux`).  

##### Example:
```java
@RestController
public class UserController {
    @GetMapping("/users/{id}")
    public Mono<User> getUser(@PathVariable Long id) {
        return userService.findById(id);
    }
}
```
- Best for developers transitioning from Spring Web, offering a gentle learning curve.

#### **Functional Programming-Based Approach**
- Uses `RouterFunction` and `HandlerFunction` for a declarative, programmatic style, defining routes and handlers explicitly.

##### Example:
```java
public RouterFunction<ServerResponse> route() {
    return RouterFunctions.route()
        .GET("/users/{id}", request -> {
            Long id = Long.valueOf(request.pathVariable("id"));
            return ServerResponse.ok().body(userService.findById(id), User.class);
        })
        .build();
}
```
- Offers greater flexibility for complex routing and is more aligned with reactive principles.

Both approaches achieve the same non-blocking outcome, but the **functional style** may appeal to those favoring a more explicit, programmatic control over routing.

### **WebFlux vs REST API (Spring Web)**

#### Scenario Illustration:
Imagine two APIs—one built with WebFlux and another with Spring Web—both tasked with fetching user details from a database for **10,000 simultaneous requests**.

#### **WebFlux API:**
- **Behavior:** The non-blocking nature allows it to handle all 10,000 requests concurrently with a small thread pool (e.g., 10 threads). When a request arrives, it’s processed asynchronously:  
  - The thread initiates a database query via **R2DBC**.  
  - It moves to handle another request while awaiting the response.  
  - Once the database responds, the result is streamed back to the client via a `Mono<User>` or `Flux<User>`.  

- **Outcome:** Efficient resource use, low latency, and high throughput, even under heavy load.

#### **Traditional REST API (Spring Web):**
- **Behavior:** Each of the 10,000 requests consumes a dedicated thread from the server’s thread pool (e.g., **200 threads by default in Tomcat**).  
  - If the database query takes **100ms**, each thread **waits idly** during that time, unable to process other requests.  
  - Once the thread pool is exhausted (after 200 requests), additional requests queue up, increasing latency or causing timeouts.

- **Outcome:** **Thread pool exhaustion, higher latency, and potential server crashes under extreme load.**

In this scenario, **WebFlux scales effortlessly**, while **Spring Web struggles**, highlighting WebFlux’s superiority for high-concurrency, I/O-bound tasks.

### CRUD Flow for a User Entity

#### **General Flow of CRUD Operations**
For a `"User"` entity (e.g., with fields `id`, `name`, `email`), the CRUD operations in WebFlux follow a **reactive, non-blocking flow**:

1. **Request:** The client sends an HTTP request (e.g., `POST /users` to create a user).
   - **Example payload:**  
     ```json
     { "name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com" }
     ```

2. **Controller:** The request is mapped to a controller method (annotation-based or functional), returning a reactive type.
   - **Example (annotation-based):**  
     ```java
     @PostMapping("/users")
     public Mono<User> createUser(@RequestBody User user) {
         return userService.save(user);
     }
     ```

3. **Service Layer:** The controller delegates to a service method, which performs business logic and interacts with the repository.
   - **Example:**
     ```java
     public Mono<User> save(User user) {
         return userRepository.save(user);
     }
     ```

4. **Database Interaction:** The repository uses **R2DBC** to execute a non-blocking database operation.
   - **Example:**
     ```java
     @Repository
     public interface UserRepository extends ReactiveCrudRepository<User, Long> {}
     ```
   - **R2DBC returns a `Mono<User>` or `Flux<User>`,** allowing the thread to handle other tasks while awaiting the database response.

5. **Response:** The reactive stream propagates back through the service and controller, transforming into an HTTP response.
   - **Example response:**  
     ```json
     { "id": 1, "name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com" }
     ```

This **ensures end-to-end non-blocking behavior**, leveraging R2DBC to maintain reactivity from client to database.

### **R2DBC vs JPA**

#### **Why R2DBC is Used Instead of JPA**
R2DBC (**Reactive Relational Database Connectivity**) is used in our  WebFlux application instead of JPA because it aligns with WebFlux’s non-blocking, **reactive paradigm**. **JPA**, designed for **synchronous, blocking** operations, would undermine WebFlux’s scalability benefits by forcing threads to wait for database responses, negating the advantages of asynchronous processing.

#### **Differences Between R2DBC and JPA**
| Feature       | JPA (with JDBC) | R2DBC |
|--------------|---------------|------|
| **Blocking vs Non-Blocking** | Blocks the thread until DB operation completes | Non-blocking, allowing higher concurrency |
| **Reactive Support** | No native reactive support | Fully integrates with Reactor (`Mono`, `Flux`) |
| **Performance** | Limited concurrency, higher resource usage | Higher throughput, lower resource consumption |

For our  API, **R2DBC ensures that database interactions don’t bottleneck the non-blocking flow**, enhancing **performance and scalability**.
